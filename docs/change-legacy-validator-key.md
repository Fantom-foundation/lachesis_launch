### Change key of a legacy validator

For legacy validators (IDs â‰¤ 59) on the Opera mainnet, the same key is currently used for both the validator address key (utilized for operations in SFC) and the validator key (employed in the creation of events). To enhance the security of key storage, we highly recommend updating the validator key, securely removing the previous key from your server, and transferring the validator address key to an air-gapped device.

1. Generate new key with `opera --datadir /path/to/datadir validator new`. Ensure you create a robust password, do not save it on the machine, and instead enter it manually after every restart for enhanced security.
2. Restart the node in a non-validating mode to prepare for the key update process.
2. Update the validator's public key by calling `sfcc.updateValidatorPubkey('0xNEWPUBKEY')` method in SFC. This can be done through the console (refer to [sfc.md](sfc.md)) by using a wallet that allows calling contract methods with a specific ABI, such as MEW with ([SFC ABI v3](../releases/sfc-abi-3.0.5-rc.1.json))
3. Restart the node in validator mode, specifying the new public key with the `--validator.pubkey` argument
4. Securely delete the old key file using: `shred -vu /path/to/datadir/keystore/validator/oldkey`. If a password file was stored on the server, remove it using `shred -vu`. Additionally, if the validator address key (can be found in `/path/to/datadir/keystore/`) was saved on the server, transfer it to an air-gapped device for better security and then erase any traces of it from the server with `shred -vu`.
